## λ-calculus interpreter
### Context
I'm intern at the University of Orléans la Source and my subject is to work about λ-calculus.  
In the second week, I have to code this little interpreter, which can calculate λ-term via beta-reduction left.

### Code specifications
There is no control terminal for this project (but it will be good to write our λ-term directly in the terminal instead of modify the file each time).

The program is in OCaml and I use only the functionnal part of the language.

All the λ-term are defined with the De Breijn's index notation. It helps enormous to have deterministic λ-terms and makes easier to calculate substitution.

The code is detailled directly in the file if you want more information.
